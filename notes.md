#### CS 61A

- This course is brutal. If you find it too hard, try [this](https://programming-23.mooc.fi/), [this](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) or [this](https://htdp.org/) first. How to Design Programs being my favorite.
 
#### CS 61B

-  Gradescope password: MB7ZPY

#### 15-213

- This course requires you to know how to program in C. I suggest going through [this](https://nostarch.com/Effective_C) and [this](https://nostarch.com/algorithmic-thinking) first.
