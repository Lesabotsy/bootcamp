### Overview

This is a guide for people who want to self-study the basics of Computer Science. There is a discord server [here](https://discord.gg/8kTaMrKS) if you're lookig for a community of self learning people. These being university courses, they won't stay online forever, make your own backup with [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for videos, and [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) for websites. Finally there are extras courses [here](https://github.com/Lesabotsy/bootcamp/blob/main/extras-courses.md), for more specialized subjetcs or to dive deeper after finishing the basics.
