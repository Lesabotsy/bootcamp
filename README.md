### Overview

This is a guide for people who want to self-study the basics of Computer Science. There is a discord server [here](https://discord.gg/8kTaMrKS) if you're lookig for a community of self learning people. These being university courses, they won't stay online forever, make your own backup with [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for videos, and [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) for websites. Finally there are extras courses [here](https://github.com/Lesabotsy/bootcamp/blob/main/extras-courses.md), for more specialized subjetcs or to dive deeper after finishing the basics.

The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view.

 - CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.
 - CS 61B deals with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and analyzing large programs.
 - CS 61C focuses on machines and how they execute programs.
