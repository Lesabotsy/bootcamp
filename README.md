### Overview

This is a guide for people who want to self-study the basics of Computer Science, for building solid foundations in order to be a web developer. There is a discord server [here](https://discord.gg/PhhaAyxq) if you're lookig for a community of self learning people. These being university courses, they won't stay online forever, make your own backup with [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for videos, and [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) for websites.

The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view.

 - CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.
 - CS 61B deals with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and analyzing large programs.
 - CS 61C focuses on machines and how they execute programs.

CSCI 0220 gives you the tools to explore interesting questions and convince yourself and others of their answers. You'll be introduced to new worlds of ideas and ways of thinking. We'll learn about Set Theory, Logic, Number Theory, Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and Probability.

Full Stack Open serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs. It covers testing, configuration and environment management, the use of databases for storing the application’s data amongst other things.

### FAQ

#### How long is this going to take?
Count 200 to 250h per course.

#### Will I be ready for a job after completion?
Yes, but make sure to build a portfolio and start networking along the way. Getting a job is matter of who you know more than what you know if you don't have a degree.
